For accomplishment of the workshop 3 new essential topic of the Object Orienter Programming was covered. In this time, we got introduced with the concept of "Incapsulation". What is "Incapsulation"? Since the IPC144, we have learned to use derived type named "struct" (data structure that contains primitive types). However, struct has a one major drawback related to its privacy. Structs are public by default. It means everyone can access and change its members (of cource including proper source or header files that contains the struct). As a result, our program can produce unexpected "behaviour" or even can be "destroyed". In C++, there is a new types of data structure called "Class". Classes are pretty much the same as the structs, but in comparison with them, classes are private by default, which makes them "incapsulated" (nobody can access its members). The access to its members can be only possible with public fuctions of the class: setters and getters. There are few differences between these two types of class functions. Setter functions can change the values of private members by using certain validation, but getters can only access and return the private value. According to this, getter function must have a return type for returning the value, but setters are always void. Moreover, in contrast with getters, setter functions can accept arguments.

There were no serios issues during the completion process of the workshop. Only two small ones. The first one was in both parts of the workshop located in the function called "isValid()" which did not display the second list properly. The second one was located in the lab part of the workshop, in the function called "setEmpty()"(null terminator was forgotten"). Fortunately, after some consideration and professor's help, the issues was succesfully solved.
