For accomplishment of the workhop 6 new essential topic of Object Oriented Programming was covered. This time, we got introduced with the concept of "Deep copies and assigments". How does this concept is utilized? When we assigning one object to another, the shallow copy is being perfomed between these two objects. This invokes the copying of values of all the members. When it comes to dynamic object, they begin to share the same memory with dynamic members of the object that was copied. As a result, we get a memory leak since in termination process only one dynamic object in this memory is being deleted. In order to avoid this issue and properly manage a memory between copies, we have to implement both copy constructor and oveloaded assignment operator. By implementing them in our program, dynamic object will get a new spot in memory instead of sharing with it with a dynamic members of the copied object. Copy constructor is used for creating a new object as a copy of existing one, and overloaded assingment operator for the objects that is already being assigned to the another object. However, we must include both the copy constructor and overloaded operator in our program because in case of absence of one of them, we might encounter issues and idefined behaviours of our program.

If to talk about the workshop 6, I would say that it was much harder that previous ones. A lot of issues were encountered during implementation process. Unfortunately, there was an issue with copy constructor and overloaded assingment operator that could not been resolved.
