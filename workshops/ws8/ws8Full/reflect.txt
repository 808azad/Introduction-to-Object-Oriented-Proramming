For the accomplishment of workshop 8, the new essential topic of Object-Oriented Programming was covered. This time, we got introduced to the concepts of virtual functions and abstract classes. What are they? Virtual functions are methods that can be overridden by derived classes in order to provide a more specific implementation. For example, if the base class and derived class have the exact same function and it is virtual in the base class, we will have two independent functions and no hiding will happen. When it comes to abstract classes, these are the types of classes that contain at least one pure virtual function (virtual functions without any implementations, which are supposed to be in derived classes). For that reason, abstract classes cannot be instantiated or directly used by client code. However, abstract classes that contain only pure virtual functions without any other data members are called Interfaces.

There were no serious issues during the completion process of the workshop. Only some minor ones at the end (during compilation) were solved without any difficulties.

When it came to Milestone 3 of the Final project, everything was smooth and convenient. All the required classes and functions were created for the mock-up application of the Seneca Library. Moreover, only the last main function that runs the application was challenging since it had a lot of implementation details that required careful consideration. Hopefully, after spending some time and putting my effort into that, I was able to successfully implement it and also solve some minor issues that occurred during the compilation process.
