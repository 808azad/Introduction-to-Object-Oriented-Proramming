Accomplishment of the workshop 1 was neiter easy nor difficult. Through the completion process, we have learned one of the most important concepts of C++ - "namespaces". What they are? In contrast with <stdio.h> library in C language, <iostream> library of C++ is much bigger. That is why, it was decided to separate the library into fewer sections - "namespaces". For example, section - "namespace" "std" of <iostream> library contains needed input-output function, that we always use, and also other functions. In the both parts of the workshops, it was required to put all the functions inside of the "namespace" called "sdds". 

In the first part of the workshop, we had to put all the given functions and constants to the proper header and source files. There were no issues while completing this part of the workshop. However, the second part, where we had to create 7 function from <cstring> library was much harder than the first one. The issues that i encoutered with were related to the implementation of logic of 2 functions - "strnCmp and strStr". Hopefully, after spending a lot of time, i was able to solve the issue.
