For accomplishment of the workshop 7 new essential topic of Object Oriented Programming was covered. This time we got introduced with a new crucial concept called inheritance. What is inheritance? Imagine, we have two classes (class a and class b). Class b contains class a as a base class. In this situation, we say that class b inherits class a, and class b is a derived class. To be more specific, let's consider another example in order to clarify the purpose of inheritance. Assume, we would like to create three classes: a class of truck, sport car and electro car. A general approach for that would be creating everything for these classes from scratch. However, this will lead to hard-coding and increase the difficulty of maintainability of the program. In this case, the best design option will be creating a base class called car, that will be inherited by the mentioned three classes, since most of their properties are the same. Thus, this base class will allow us not only avoid hard-coding, but also increase the flexibility and convenience of the design.

There were no issues encountered during accomplishment process of the workshop. Everything was perfect and no assistance was requred to complete it.

When it comes to the milestone 1 of the final project, everything becomes much more complicated. A lot of issues were faced during accomplishment process. Date module was much easier than the menu one, but still there were issue with displaying of error messages related to irrelevant dates. In the menu module the faced issues were memory leaks that occured due to incorrect deallocation of dynamic memory and incorrect display of header because of the overloaded ostream operator that supposed to be helper, but initially was created as a member one, and boolean operator that was created not as a constant. Hopefully, by the help of the professor, all the issues were succesfully resolved and the milestone was succesfully submitted.
