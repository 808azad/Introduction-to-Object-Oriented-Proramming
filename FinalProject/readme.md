# This is The Final Project Folder
Here are all the milestones of the final project completed during this course.

**Name of The Project**: Seneca Library Application

Description: When Books and other publications arrive in the Seneca library, they should be tagged and put on shelves, so they are easily retrievable to be lent out to those who need them. A task is to design an application that receives the publications and stores them into the system with the information needed for their retrieval.

Later, each publication can be lent out to members of the library with a due date for return.
